# Getting started with Quantum Cryptography

### Pre-requisites: 
It is preferable to already have some background in the basics of quantum computing, if you'd like a refresher, check out a list of resources we've curated for you [here](https://github.com/QForestCommunity/launchpad/blob/master/README.md)!
### Few resources to help you get started in quantum cryptography:
- [Quantum Cryptography](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CaltechDelftX+QuCryptox+3T2018/course/): This course provides an in-depth introduction to quantum computing and quantum information followed by a thorough mathematical introduction to the different facets of quantum cryptography and different QKD protocols.
